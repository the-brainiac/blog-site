## [Live Demo](https://blogsite.pythonanywhere.com/)
I built this web app for better understanding of foreign keys and one to one, many to many relationships.
This web app handles 3 models-
- User CRUD
- Blog CRUD
- Comments CRD (Updation of comments is not allowed)  

> CRUD -- `Creation Retrieval Updation Deletion`
## Features:
- Users can register themselves
- Users can change their passwords
- Users can reset their password if forgot (process is handles using SMTP )
- Authenticated users can create their blogs
- Users can delete or edit their blogs ( Only the blogs that created by them)
- Users can make comments on all the blogs
- Users can delete their comments ( Only the comments that created by them)
- Users can like or dislike the blogs
- Trending blogs will be ranked automatically on the basis of number of likes and dislikes.
- User can search for blogs
- Users can contact the owner. (Process is handled using SMTP)
## New Features I would like to add: 
I would like to add some new feature to this site that is,
- User could reply to particular comment
- User could search other users and message them
